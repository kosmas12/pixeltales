# Pixeltales

Pixeltales is an RPG with old-school graphics
set in a fantasy world. Use magic and all kinds
of weapons against your enemies in your
ultimate quest to save the world. Spanning multiple
different planets, each with its own unique atmosphere
and gameplay, immerse yourself in Pixeltales' massive world!

It's meant to be as light and performant as possible, 
and as a 2D game with simple graphics it should be able 
to run on a wide variety of hardware.

# License

This game is licensed under the MIT license, but some of the code
(Specifically, the OpenGL graphics backend) uses source files
that were generated by GLAD, which are licensed under the
Public Domain (according to [GLAD's README file](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad#whats-the-license-of-glad-generated-code))

# State
Not playable yet, starting to implement the first backends.
Planned initial backends are:

- **Graphics: OpenGL (Modern, meaning version 3.3)**
- **Input: GLFW**
- **Audio: SDL_Audio**

# Requirements and how to run:
Here's what you need to generate a Pixeltales executable:
- **The CMake build system**
- **A C++ compiler supporting C++ 11 or a later standard**
- **Depending on what graphics backend you're going to use, 
a graphics card that supports it along with a driver. 
For example, the modern OpenGL backend requires a 
graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 support, but there's also 
a planned Vulkan backend, which will be supported by much 
newer graphics cards than those that support OpenGL 3.3. 
In case of doubt, check your graphics driver for API support**

And in order to generate the executable, run these commands:
```shell
# Generate build directory
cmake -B build
# Do actual build
cmake --build build
```

By default, this will compile the modern OpenGL graphics backend,
GLFW input backend and SDL_Audio audio backend. To change the used
backend, refer to the options list in the CMakeLists.txt file
and set accordingly, for example:

```shell
# Use Vulkan for graphics (NOTE: This does not actually work yet)
cmake -DUSE_VULKAN=ON -B build
cmake --build build
```

Finally, after you're done compiling, run the executable in the
directory you specified to build
